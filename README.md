The Covid19 Pandemic has affected billions worldwide, and while we are all stuck in quarantine, I thought of utilizing my time in making something useful, 
So here's presenting : MASKINATOR 3000, a web app that can tell whether someone is wearing a mask or not. It can be deployed in Offices and in Shops, and can automatically check if people entering the building are wearing face masks or not and automatically inform the concerned authorities about the same.
